#Emoji Hunter

Emoji Hunter is simple but addictive shoot'em up game. The goal of the game is to kill and collect as many happy emoticons as possible, without getting killed. The terrain obstacles are generated randomly, a bunch of emoticons are also spawn randomly at the start of the game and keep spawning whenever one is killed. Your job is to survive wave after wave of emojis and increase your high score. More updates are on the way and the developers have promised big plans for the game :)
