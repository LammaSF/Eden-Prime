General game ideas:
==================================================
Game theme:
1. Player and neverending wave of spawning monsters, shoot them all till you die

2. Player and 2 or 3 enemies, which are hard to kill
(they are invisible most of the time and you can hardly understand where they are in a given moment)

3. Player and enemies/friends, the enemy-friend is enemy part of the time and friend part of the time
(when it becomes an enemy you are running away from it and vice versa - you chase after it when in friend mode)


What are we after?
-original game or easy game
