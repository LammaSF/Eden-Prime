#Design Smells

* UIHero.cs many responsibilities: keyboard input handling, label drawing, collision handling should probably be separated
* Bad hierarchy in the data folder - Emoticons, Hero, Obstacles, Spellshots should have common abstraction
* Many classes exceed 100-120 lines of code (bad design?)
* Downcasting: is & as operators in the collision handling
* Common object is needed for Save/Load functionality
* Multiple cases of concrete class dependencies
